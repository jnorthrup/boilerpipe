#summary Components of the Boilerpipe API

= Introduction =

Boilerpipe consists of the following components:

  # an HTML parser that transforms HTML into an internal text-only document model supporting "blocks" of text.
  # several Filter components analyze and tag these text blocks
  # extractors consisting of one or more Filters. Such "pipelines" take the parsed document object and distill the main textual content from it
  # an HTML highlighter to visually inspect the extracted main content within a copy of the input page.

To understand why boilerpipe works read the paper "[http://www.l3s.de/~kohlschuetter/publications/wsdm187-kohlschuetter.pdf Boilerplate Detection using Shallow Text Features]" by Christian Kohlsch√ºtter et al., presented at WSDM 2010 -- The Third ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining New York City, NY USA.

Please note that boilerpipe is a re-implementation of the code used in this paper. We have found some minor differences between the two implementations, which we have planned to fix in a later release of boilerpipe.
