#summary Components of the Boilerpipe API

= Introduction =

Boilerpipe consists of the following components:

  # an HTML parser that transforms HTML into an internal text-only document model supporting "blocks" of text.
  # several Filter components analyze and tag these text blocks
  # extractors consisting of one or more Filters. Such "pipelines" take the parsed document object and distill the main textual content from it
  # an HTML highlighter to visually inspect the extracted main content within a copy of the input page.
