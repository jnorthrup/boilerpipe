#summary How to get started

= Installation =

  # Get a binary and/or source tarball from the [http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/downloads/list Downloads page]
  # Extract the files somewhere
{{{
    tar xvzf boilerpipe-1.0-bin.tar.gz
    tar xvzf boilerpipe-1.0-src.tar.gz
}}}
  # Add `boilerpipe-1.0.jar` to your Java classpath

= Usage =

Once you have boilerpipe on your classpath, extracting the "main" content from a Web page is really simple:

{{{
   URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com/some-location/index.html");
   String text = DefaultExtractor.INSTANCE.getText(url);
}}}


Please also have a look at the [http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/source/browse/#svn/tags/BOILERPIPE_1_0_0/boilerpipe-core/src/demo/de/l3s/boilerpipe/demo demo classes].

Besides the [http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/source/browse/trunk/boilerpipe-core/src/main/de/l3s/boilerpipe/extractors/DefaultExtractor.java DefaultExtractor] there are [http://boilerpipe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boilerpipe-core/javadoc/1.0/de/l3s/boilerpipe/BoilerpipeExtractor.html other extractors] that may be more suitable for particular content scenarios. For example, [http://boilerpipe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boilerpipe-core/javadoc/1.0/de/l3s/boilerpipe/extractors/ArticleExtractor.html ArticleExtractor] adds some heuristics to extract the main content from a news page. There is also [http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/source/browse/trunk/boilerpipe-core/src/main/de/l3s/boilerpipe/extractors/NumWordsRulesExtractor.java NumWordsRulesExtractor] which resembles the number-of-words-based decision tree presented in the [WSDM2010Paper WSDM 2010 Paper] (Algorithm 2).

There are also [http://boilerpipe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boilerpipe-core/javadoc/1.0/de/l3s/boilerpipe/extractors/ExtractorBase.html other ways] to call the Extractor (using `Reader`, `InputSource`, `String` etc.).

See the [http://boilerpipe.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/boilerpipe-core/javadoc/1.0/index.html API Javadocs] for details.

= Customizing =

You are invited to improve, customize and extend Boilerpipe. See here for details on [Components how the boilerpipe components work together].
